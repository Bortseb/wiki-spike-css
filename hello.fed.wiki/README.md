# Hello Fed Wiki
These files create a minimally useable implementation of federated wiki.
They will serve as a reference for more elaborate versions and as a test bed for features where our legacy has been weak.
- Reasonable behavior on mobile and other touch devices.
- Deployable as a single, reusable CDN module.

Try this preview version at [hello.fed.wiki](http://hello.fed.wiki).
