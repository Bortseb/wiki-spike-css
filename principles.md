# Visual Design Principles
By federating wiki we seek a new balance between ownership and collaboration.
A decade of experience shows we have made many good decisions.
Now we enumerate and prioritize the best of these so that we can consider new implemenation without harming what we have made.

This document will mimic wiki's item mobility by writing initially in single line paragraphs.
Each item begins with a quotable statement in bold followed by disambiguating explaination of purpose.
Initially we expect this to serve as a guide to discussion and later an outline for a more stand alone document.

We will eventually mine historic talks and videos to be sure original intentions will be faithfully reconsidered.

## Reading

__One Width.__ Adjust column width and scale such that text flows in a consistent and highly readable ten words on all devices.

## Authoring

__Simple Sequence.__ Constrain items of a story, actions of a journal, and panels of a lineup in a flat linear order using only links for additional structure. This ensures that reorganizations are easily interpreted.

## Curating

## Administrating
