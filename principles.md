# Visual Design Principles
By federating wiki we seek a new balance between ownership and collaboration.
A decade of experience shows we have made many good decisions.
Now we enumerate and prioritize the best of these so that we can consider new implemenation without harming what we have made.

This document will mimic wiki's item mobility by writing initially in single line paragraphs.
Each item begins with a quotable statement in bold followed by disambiguating explaination of purpose.
Initially we expect this to serve as a guide to discussion and later an outline for a more stand alone document.

We will eventually mine historic talks and videos to be sure original intentions will be faithfully reconsidered.
Asperational principles will be noted as "new".

## Reading

__One Width.__ Adjust column width and scale such that text flows in a consistent and highly readable ten words on all devices.

__Dark Mode.__ New. Detect and respect when a viewer has chosen low brightness background due to situation or preference.

__Nav History.__ Respect the browser back and forward controls to undo and redo navigation. [video](http://video.fed.wiki.org/10-scrolling-history-tests.html)

__Item Inputs.__ New. Show where items provide information used by others.

__Incremental Search.__ Consistent and meaningful terminology with tool-tips for alternatives.

__Lineup.__ Links stack panels replacing or adding to those previously viewed from a given page. [video](http://video.fed.wiki.org/05-columns-desktop-dragging.html)

__Flags.__ Sites in the federation are identified by consistently generated images representing both wiki and author's brand. [video](http://video.fed.wiki.org/10-scrolling-history-tests.html)

__Direct Manipulation.__ Some items expose temporary adjustments such as hover, drill-down, pan and zoom. E.g. Map, Assets, Frame, others?

## Authoring

__Natural Extension.__ The act of reading extends easily into writing in an unchanged context.

__Simple Sequence.__ Constrain items of a story, actions of a journal, and panels of a lineup in a flat linear order using only links for additional structure. This ensures that reorganizations are easily interpreted.

__Visible History.__ An author can see change at other's hands and retrieve desired improvements. [video](http://video.fed.wiki.org/01-story-and-journal.html)

__Refactoring.__ Edit operation moves items within and between pages, extending to retrival from remote sites. [video](http://video.fed.wiki.org/02-cross-page-referencing.html)

__Markup.__ Edit operation allows revision of item text which will permentantly change the appearence or behavior of an item.

__Direct Editing.__ Some items expose direct modifications which are made permenant by recording the Action. E.g. Map, Markdown, FiveStar, Journalmatic others?

__Voice Editing.__ New. Wiki relies on complete sentences which are hard to enter on phone keyboards. Can we dictate edits to pages? Any kind of edit anywhere on a page?

__Ghost Pages.__ The lineup has room for past and future versions of a page easily compared with the current version on the server.

__Collaborative Reference.__ Consult page context to find links, images, assets, and not yet scripts.

## Administrating

__Limited Resource.__ New. Admin can set limits and authors can see how choices advance toward or exceed these limits.

__Direct Configuration.__ Some items expose server reconfigurations made permenant and non-reversable by server writes. E.g. Assets, Plugmatic, Flagmatic, Register, others?
