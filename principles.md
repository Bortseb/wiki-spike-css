# Visual Design Principles
By federating wiki we seek a new balance between ownership and collaboration.
A decade of experience shows we have made many good decisions.
Now we enumerate and prioritize the best of these so that we can consider new implemenation without harming what we have made.

This document will mimic wiki's item mobility by writing initially in single line paragraphs.
Each item begins with a quotable statement in bold followed by disambiguating explaination of purpose.
Initially we expect this to serve as a guide to discussion and later an outline for a more stand alone document.

We will eventually mine historic talks and videos to be sure original intentions will be faithfully reconsidered.
Asperational principles will be noted as "new".

## Reading

__One Width.__ Adjust column width and scale such that text flows in a consistent and highly readable ten words on all devices.

__Dark Mode.__ New. Detect and respect when a viewer has chosen low brightness background due to situation or preference.

__Nav History__ Respect the browser back and forward controls to undo and redo navigation.

__Item Inputs__ New. Show where items provide information used by others.

## Authoring

__Simple Sequence.__ Constrain items of a story, actions of a journal, and panels of a lineup in a flat linear order using only links for additional structure. This ensures that reorganizations are easily interpreted.

## Curating

## Administrating

__Limited Resource.__ New. Admin can set limits and authors can see how choices advance toward or exceed these limits.
